# V1 Regression Check

## Checking for rank20_ references in runtime code:

```bash
git grep -n "rank20_" src || echo OK
```

**Expected Output:** OK (no matches found)

## Checking for diag_rank20 references:

```bash  
git grep -n "diag_rank20" src || echo OK
```

**Expected Output:** OK (no matches found)

**Status:** Manual verification required
**Note:** These greps verify no V1 Arena code remains in the runtime source files, ensuring clean V2 implementation.
