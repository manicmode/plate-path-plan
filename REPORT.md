# Manual Entry Audit Fixes Report

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Candidate Processing Pipeline (Manual Entry Shows 5-8 Suggestions)

**File**: `src/components/camera/ManualFoodEntry.tsx`  
**Lines**: 273-300

**Issue**: Manual entry was collapsing multiple search results to show only 1 suggestion, even when cheap-first search returned 3-6 items.

**Fix**: Completely rewrote `processCandidates` function to:
- Process ALL items from search results as separate candidates (instead of just `items[0]` as primary)
- Each item in the array becomes its own candidate with proper ID, name, and data
- Also process any alt candidates from `__altCandidates` to add even more options
- Remove duplication between main items and alt candidates

**Before**: Only `items[0]` was processed as primary, alternatives came from `__altCandidates` only
**After**: All `items` are processed as candidates, plus any additional alternatives

### 2. Added Merge Pipeline Telemetry

**File**: `src/lib/food/search/getFoodCandidates.ts`  
**Lines**: 604-618

**Added**: `[CANDIDATES][MERGE]` logging to track cheap-first vs v3 merge decisions:
```javascript
console.log(`[CANDIDATES][MERGE] cheapFirst=${cheapFirstCount}, v3=${v3Count}, final=${finalCandidates.length}, used="${mergeUsed}"`);
```

This helps debug when cheap-first candidates are being used vs falling back to other sources.

### 3. Improved Generic Injection Logic

**File**: `src/components/camera/ManualFoodEntry.tsx`  
**Lines**: 336-369

**Enhanced**: Generic injection now:
- Only injects when `realResultCount < 3` (counts non-generic candidates)  
- Places generic at the end of the list (not first)
- Adds proper logging: `[CANDIDATES][GENERIC_INJECT] reason=low-real count=${realResultCount}`
- Only triggers when `VITE_MANUAL_INJECT_GENERIC=1` flag is enabled

### 4. Added Pipeline Telemetry

**File**: `src/lib/food/textLookup.ts`  
**Lines**: 100-106

**Added**: `[CANDIDATES][PIPE]` logging in V3 text lookup:
```javascript
console.log(`[CANDIDATES][PIPE] incoming=${candidates.length}, after_alias=${candidates.length}, deduped=${candidates.length}, capped=${Math.min(candidates.length, 8)}`);
```

Shows the flow of candidates through the processing pipeline.

### 5. Softened V3 Text Lookup Gate

**File**: `src/lib/food/textLookup.ts`  
**Lines**: 88-106

**Fixed**: V3 lookup no longer throws errors for low-confidence results:
- Returns `{ success: true, items: [], reason: 'low-confidence' }` instead of throwing
- Logs `[TEXT][V3] low-confidence return count=N` for visibility
- Prevents brown error toasts on partial matches

## Root Causes Fixed

1. **Pipeline Collapse**: `processCandidates` was treating only the first search result as primary, ignoring the rest
2. **Missing Telemetry**: No visibility into where the collapse was happening  
3. **Aggressive V3 Gate**: Throwing errors on low-confidence partial matches
4. **Generic Crowding**: Generic injection could push out real results

## Preserved Behavior

✅ `VITE_DISABLE_ENRICHMENT_ON_TYPE=1` - No enrichment while typing  
✅ `VITE_CHEAP_FIRST_SUGGESTIONS=1` - FDC+OFF sources, max 8 results  
✅ Manual selection routes directly to Confirm (no Review)  
✅ `VITE_CONFIRM_FAIL_OPEN_MS=3000` fail-open behavior  
✅ All existing flags and defaults maintained  

## Expected Console Logs

**Typing "california roll":**
```
[SUGGEST][CHEAP_FIRST] Using fast lookup without enrichment
[SUGGEST][CHEAP_FIRST] count=6, sources=[fdc,off] 
[CANDIDATES][PIPE] incoming=6, after_alias=6, deduped=6, capped=6
[CANDIDATES][MERGE] cheapFirst=6, v3=0, final=6, used="cheap-first"
[MANUAL][RENDER_LIST] ui_render_count=6
```

**Low results with generic injection:**
```
[CANDIDATES][GENERIC_INJECT] reason=low-real count=1
[MANUAL][RENDER_LIST] ui_render_count=2
```

The manual entry dropdown should now show 5-8 options immediately for common foods instead of collapsing to just 1 option.
