## Startup Chime (startup_chime.wav)

For the startup sound, you'll need to add a 2.5-second ambient/chime sound file named `startup_chime.wav` to this directory.

Recommended characteristics:
- Duration: 2-2.5 seconds
- Volume: Soft and soothing
- Type: Ambient chime, soft bell, or healing tone
- Format: WAV or MP3
- Similar to: Apple Mac startup chime or meditation bell

You can find suitable sounds at:
- Freesound.org (search for "startup chime", "meditation bell", "ambient tone")
- Zapsplat.com (royalty-free sound effects)

- Or record your own using audio software

The sound will automatically play when the app splash screen appears during cold starts.
