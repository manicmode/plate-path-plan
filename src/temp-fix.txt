Fixed syntax errors in Camera.tsx:
1. Cleaned up orphaned barcode code blocks
2. Fixed function structure and closing braces
3. Ensured proper JSX structure
4. Added manual barcode handler

The core barcode confirmation flow is now working:
- Uses analyzeBarcode pipeline instead of broken edge functions
- Opens confirmation modal properly
- Log Your Food window stays persistent during loading

Main changes:
- Replaced broken edge function calls with working barcode pipeline
- Fixed syntax errors and orphaned code
- Added proper error handling
- Maintained Log Your Food window visibility
